## Overview
This project is an implementation of a **web crawler** and **form brute-forcer** that can "**autonomously navigate websites**, collecting and tokenizing all the words that it finds which it will later use as potential passwords on the website's login form". In addition, the crawler will "**autonomously identify the login page** and also detect whether a **combination of username and password was successful** or not".
