This project is an implementation of a **web crawler** and **form brute-forcer** that can:
  * "autonomously navigate websites, collecting and tokenizing all the words that it finds which it will later use as potential passwords on the website's login form" 
  * "autonomously identify the login page and also detect whether a combination of username and password was successful or not"
